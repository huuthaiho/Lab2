
1. Sometime we want to use SetImmediate because we want to push in priority Queue the callback function behind I/O event callbacks that
are already in event queue.

2. Process.nextTick vs SetImmediate
process.NextTick() would executed at next tick of event loop. However, the setImmediate, basically has a separate phase 
which ensures that the callback registered under setImmediate() will be called only after the IO callback and polling phase.
